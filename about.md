My passion for programming and technology began when my father bought me my first computer at secen years old. By age twelve I was quickly teaching myself how to code on my custom built desktop. A decade later and my passion for software engineering has yet to fade. As a current diligent student of the online school Team Treehouse, I continue to broaden my programming kowledge and have vegun perusing my future career as a top level engineer. Recently promoted to husband and father, I spend all of my spare time with my beautiful wife and new daughter.

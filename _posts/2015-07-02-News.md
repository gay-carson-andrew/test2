I decided to go with <A HREF="#link_Jeykll">Jeykll</A> and <A HREF="#link_Github_Pages">Github Pages</A> because of their limitless capabilities and cost.[1][2]

Currently the average price for a domain is between <A HREF="#link_Google_Search_Average_Prices"><b class="big">$8-10</b></A> per year. Hosting a website with a domain you would need eight usd. As for the hosts, many providers out there offer <A HREF="link_Wiki_Free_Hosting"><b class="big">free host services.</b></A>[3][4]

I decided to go with <a HREF="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jeykll</a> and <a HREF="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</A> because of their limitless capabilities and cost.[<A HREF="#link_Jeykll">1</a>][<a HREF="#link_Github_Pages">2</a>]

Currently the average price for a domain is between <a HREF="#link_Google_Search_Average_Prices"><b class="big">$8-10</b></a> per year. Hosting a website with a domain you would need eight usd. As for the hosts, many providers out there offer <a HREF="link_Wiki_Free_Hosting"><b class="big">free host services.</b></a>[<a HREF="#link_Google_Search_Average_Prices">3</a>][<a HREF="link_Wiki_Free_Hosting">4</a>]
